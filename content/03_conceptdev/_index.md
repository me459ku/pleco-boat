## Concept Selection 
For this project's concept development, the team conducted extensive research into existing market solutions for both big- and small-scale applications. After spending enough time independently investigating solution. Elements of the device has been divided into several parts; hence the concepts are divided into functions:

-	Boat
-	Driving mechanism
-	Power source
-	Collecting mechanism
-	Sensors


After generating the concepts of the components of the device that is set to be manufactured, a comparison has to be done in order to filter out the ideas that are not as worthy as the others and the main components which were choosen for the Pleco Boat are solar panels, conveyor belt, propeller and pontoon.
