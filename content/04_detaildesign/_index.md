## Design overview 
The Pleco Boat consists of a mixture of components that are combined together to form the most feasible assembly thought of and are drawn using the Solidworks software. The boat is chosen to be a pontoon and has been ordered from an online store. a reverse engineering method is used to measure the dimensions of the components, this step shall be the first step of the system level design. The driving mechanism is set to be propellers. The powering mechanism of the systemâ€™s electricity and power is chosen to be solar therefore solar panels are to be integrated into the design. The storing mechanism of trash and collected waste is simply a perforated basket. The catching mechanism of waste is chosen to be the conveyor belt. The design also has an elictrical part.
