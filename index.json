Because sea waste is leading to huge problems for the government, people and the planet its an important to tackle such a problem. As it is an obligation for everyone to help in solving a problem that affects everyone and if a solution is not to be found the problem will get bigger and more dangerous. As engineers we found that solving this problem smartly is a must.\nMission Satement Option Description Product Description sustainable, easy to use, affordable, wind resistance, portable, corrosion resistant, sustain heavy weight, can be disassembled, remotely controlled, recyclable, easy to set up, controlled speed, lightweight, supported with LED signals, accurate sensors, safe. Benefit Proposition Cleans the sea, Portable, Warranty, Suited for high temperature Primary Market Ministry of environment (Environment public authority Secondary Market Scientific center, Individuals Stakeholders Ministry, Boatshops Assumptions and Constraints Average wave speed, Maximum operational temperature, Trunk size, Constant speed of conveyor belt.

After spending enough time independently investigating solution. Elements of the device has been divided into several parts; hence the concepts are divided into functions:\nBoat Driving mechanism Power source Collecting mechanism Sensors After generating the concepts of the components of the device that is set to be manufactured, a comparison has to be done in order to filter out the ideas that are not as worthy as the others and the main components which were choosen for the Pleco Boat are solar panels, conveyor belt, propeller and pontoon.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/04_detaildesign/","title":"Detailed Design","tags":[],"description":"","content":"A presentation by Mohammed Awayda and Anas Hamdan explaining the detailed design\nDesign overview The Pleco Boat consists of a mixture of components that are combined together to form the most feasible assembly thought of and are drawn using the Solidworks software. The boat is chosen to be a pontoon and has been ordered from an online store. a reverse engineering method is used to measure the dimensions of the components, this step shall be the first step of the system level design. The driving mechanism is set to be propellers. The powering mechanism of the systemâ€™s electricity and power is chosen to be solar therefore solar panels are to be integrated into the design. The storing mechanism of trash and collected waste is simply a perforated basket. The catching mechanism of waste is chosen to be the conveyor belt. The design also has an elictrical part.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/05_manufacturing/","title":"Manufacturing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Manufacturing Process The figure shows the flow diagram of the manufacturing process followed to achieve the design assembly and final product. The manufacturing process consists of four main techniques used which are Laser cutting, Welding, Nonpermanent joints and soldering. Those were used to manufacture the main component of the pleco boat and to reach the prototype of the design.\nPrototype "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/","title":"Summary","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Pleco Boat Abstract The Pleco Boat was made to solve the problem of dealing with the collected waste on seashores which danger the marine life and lead to pollution it is designed to be a remotely controlled boat that allows the user to clean the seashores. A whole designing cycle was done so that the device is efficient on every aspect by a team of four undergraduate Kuwait University students.\nDone by\nAbdulaziz Lotfi Mohammed Awayda Bader Alhadidi Anas Hamdan "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/03_conceptdev/functional-decomposition/","title":"Functional Decomposition","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/02_probdef/missionstatement/","title":"Mission Statement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Objective "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/pleco-boat/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
